<h1 align="center">Bastion Insight Engine (BIE)</h1>

**Status:** `Concept / Early Research Only ⚠️`

_The Bastion Insight Engine (BIE) is a conceptual security and compliance management platform focused on the DoD / Federal cybersecurity space. At this stage, BIE represents design research, architectural thinking, and capability exploration, **not** a production-ready tool._

## What I Have Planned (Conceptually)
BIE is envisioned as a **standalone executable application** that helps centralize, reason about, and manage security posture and compliance evidence across **Windows and Linux environments**.

## Core Capability Areas (High-Level)
- Assessment & evidence ingestion  
- Explainable risk and exposure analysis  
- STIG review and remediation automation  
- Continuous audit policy verification  
- Enclave-level compliance and posture visibility  

## Design Philosophy
- Standalone, no mandatory SIEM dependency  
- Evidence-first, deterministic, and explainable logic  
- Optimized for reducing repetitive compliance effort  
- Focused on audit defensibility and operational clarity
