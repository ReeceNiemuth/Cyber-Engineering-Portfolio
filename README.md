# 🛡️ Cyber Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cyber-Engineering-Portfolio** — a curated collection of my **home lab builds, DoD-aligned documentation, and engineering experiments**.  

This repository demonstrates my work as an **ISSO/ISSE-in-training** by replicating the same standards, artifacts, and processes used in **Special Access Programs (SAP)** and **Mission Assurance environments**.

## 📂 What’s Inside

### 🔹 Documentation & Artifacts
- **System Security Plan (SSP)** — baseline architecture, system details, and control implementations  
- **SCTM (Security Control Traceability Matrix)** — mapping controls to implementation & testing  
- **Configuration Management Plan (CM Plan)** — tracking changes, baselines, and approval workflows  
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** — playbooks for handling cyber incidents in lab environments  
- **Continuity & Disaster Recovery Plans (CP/DRP)** — strategies for lab resilience and recovery  
- **Risk / Trade Study Log** — decisions, alternatives, and engineering trade-offs  
- **Control Validation / Test Plan** — testing methodology for security controls  
- **Baselines** — hardware and software inventories maintained like a real SAP system  
- **Diagrams** — Security Architecture, Network/Data Flow, and Visual Concept Diagrams  

### 🔹 Codebase & Automation
- 🐍 **Python scripts** for log parsing, automation, and STIG/SCAP processing  
- ⚙️ **Ansible playbooks** for patching and configuration automation  
- 📊 **Splunk dashboards** for STIG validation, ISSO evidence collection, and compliance views  
- 🛠️ **Custom TAs & configs** (Qmulos, Splunk, Windows/Linux log sources)  

### 🔹 Engineering Focus
- **STIG & SCAP Enforcement** — hands-on hardening and compliance testing  
- **Splunk + Qmulos Integration** — building compliance dashboards for RMF/JSIG evidence  
- **Continuous Monitoring (ConMon)** — dashboards, alerts, and automated evidence generation  
- **Home Lab Experiments** — mini-rack builds, virtualization, and cyber engineering practice

## 🚀 Goals of This Portfolio
- 📜 Demonstrate **DoD-compliant engineering practices** in a home lab  
- 🔧 Showcase **hands-on automation skills** in security engineering  
- 🛡️ Build and maintain **evidence-driven compliance artifacts** like an ISSO/ISSE would  
- 🧭 Serve as a **training ground** for ISSO → ISSE career progression
