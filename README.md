# 🛡️ Cyber Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cyber-Engineering-Portfolio** — a curated collection of my **home lab builds, DoD-aligned documentation, and engineering experiments**.  

This repository demonstrates my work as an DoD sector cybersecurity professional by replicating the same standards, artifacts, and processes.
